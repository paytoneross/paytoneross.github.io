            <div>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am currently a sophmore/junior at Boise State University studying Games,
                    Interactive Media,
                    and Mobile Technologies (GIMM). I say sophmore/junior because I am fast tracking through the program
                    and I am anticipating
                    graduation in Spring 2026 after 3 years of schooling. I am very excited to have found a career where
                    I love what I do and
                    I am eager to contribute something meaningful to the industry. My goal is to become a gameplay
                    software developer, or game
                    level designer, and hopefully someday make my way up to being a creative director on a AAA game
                    project.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outside from school, I work as a Phlebotomist. I perform outpatient blood
                    draws on patients of all age ranges,
                    and coordinate with MLS and lab staff on processing, transport, and resulting of medical lab tests.
                    I used to be a nursing major before I
                    switched to GIMM, and in my time in nursing I found my way over to the lab. I am still very
                    interested in healthcare and science, and I love being
                    a part of such a great team. Not many people like getting their blood drawn, and I try as hard as I
                    can to make it a pleasant, quick, and painless
                    experience.
                </p>
                <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In my free time I enjoy spending time with my friends and family, playing
                    music, video games,
                    snowboarding, skateboarding, wakeboarding, any type of boarding really. I play a few instruments,
                    and I love listening to music. The way that music
                    makes me feel is one of my biggest inspirations in making games, I want to be able to create
                    experiences that can instill those kinds of feelings in
                    others. Below you will find a list of some of my favorite games, shows, and musicians. The most
                    recent game I have played at this point is The Legend
                    of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and I absolutely loved it.

                <div>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the first project that I worked on in the program. I was just
                        starting working in Unity and in Animate, as you can
                        see from my state of the art animation and shading. We had to chose one of three 2D stub games,
                        a platformer,
                        tower defense, or top down shooter, and make our own game out of them. I chose the platformer,
                        and I decided to create a
                        game that combines platforming challenges with metroidvania-like exploration and progression.
                        The player explores the interior
                        of a scary haunted pyramid, and has find movement upgrades in order to survive and escape.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My initial idea for the game was much
                        grander than I ended up being able to make, but I'm still proud of what I came up with. The
                        biggest things I took from this game
                        were learning how to work in sprints, avoiding out-scoping myself, and what makes a small game
                        punch above its weight class.
                        When I look back on this game now, all that I see is everything that is wrong with it and how
                        much better I could do it now,
                        which I think that shows how far I've come. Below is a trailer that I made for this game in my
                        current Interactive Audio/Video class.

                <p class="center" id="subtitle">Interactive Comic</p>
                <div>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this project, we were tasked with creating a comic that explained a
                        complex quantum science principle. For our group, it was the bi-directional flow of time.
                        Given how complex our topic is, we decided to make a story where we apply this concept to a
                        character narrative and show the effects that this theory could
                        have on someone. We thought a lot about how to create a powerful story that displays this topic
                        in a way that the average person can understand and sympathize with.
                        My contributions to this project were 4 comic panels, narrative/dialogue writing, Unity
                        implementation, and development of the mini game.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The class we were in was all about visual storytelling, the ways that
                        people percieve information, and methods to subtly convey meaning without people realizing.
                        One of the ways I applied these concepts to my work was by making a mini auto runner game where
                        the player runs to the left instead of the right like they normally do in the genre.
                        Combining this with a playspace that evolves as you progress helps to create an experience were
                        everything comes together to make you feel like you are travelling backwards in time.
                        Below are two videos, one of me explaining the project and my contributions in more detail, and
                        one of a full playthrough of our comic.

                <p class="center" id="subtitle">AR Group Project</p>
                <div>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the second game I developed in my first semester, and the
                        first group game project I worked on in the program. The assignment was to make an
                        AR game experience that could be played on a mobile device. After a few brainstorming sessions,
                        we decided on an FPS where you would spawn a castle using
                        plane detection and once you do a bunch of tiny guys start shooting at you. The goal is to clear
                        them all out while dodging their shots by moving around.
                        My contribution to this project was assisting with AR implementation, the design of the castle,
                        the shooting mechanics, touch screen controls, and UI/UX and HUD design.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We only had a few weeks to put this project together, and I'm very
                        proud of what we made and how much we learned in such a short amount of time.
                        My biggest takeaways from this project was the value of working on projects as a team. They say
                        teams are stronger than heroes, and that was proven to me
                        when we worked on this project. Below is a demo video of our nearly finalized game.
