                <div>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the first project that I worked on in the program. I
                        was just
                        starting working in Unity and in Animate, as you can
                        see from my state of the art animation and shading. We had to chose one of three 2D stub
                        games,
                        a platformer,
                        tower defense, or top down shooter, and make our own game out of them. I chose the
                        platformer,
                        and I decided to create a
                        game that combines platforming challenges with metroidvania-like exploration and
                        progression.
                        The player explores the interior
                        of a scary haunted pyramid, and has find movement upgrades in order to survive and
                        escape.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My initial idea for the game was much
                        grander than I ended up being able to make, but I'm still proud of what I came up with.
                        The
                        biggest things I took from this game
                        were learning how to work in sprints, avoiding out-scoping myself, and what makes a
                        small game
                        punch above its weight class.
                        When I look back on this game now, all that I see is everything that is wrong with it
                        and how
                        much better I could do it now,
                        which I think that shows how far I've come. Below is a trailer that I made for this game
                        in my
                        current Interactive Audio/Video class.

            <div class="black col-md-4 whiteborder comic">
                <p class="center" id="subtitle">Interactive Comic</p>
                <div>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In this project, we were tasked with creating a comic that
                        explained a
                        complex quantum science principle. For our group, it was the bi-directional flow of
                        time.
                        Given how complex our topic is, we decided to make a story where we apply this concept
                        to a
                        character narrative and show the effects that this theory could
                        have on someone. We thought a lot about how to create a powerful story that displays
                        this topic
                        in a way that the average person can understand and sympathize with.
                        My contributions to this project were 4 comic panels, narrative/dialogue writing, Unity
                        implementation, and development of the mini game.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The class we were in was all about visual storytelling, the
                        ways that
                        people percieve information, and methods to subtly convey meaning without people
                        realizing.
                        One of the ways I applied these concepts to my work was by making a mini auto runner
                        game where
                        the player runs to the left instead of the right like they normally do in the genre.
                        Combining this with a playspace that evolves as you progress helps to create an
                        experience were
                        everything comes together to make you feel like you are travelling backwards in time.
                        Below are two videos, one of me explaining the project and my contributions in more
                        detail, and
                        one of a full playthrough of our comic.

                <p class="center" id="subtitle">AR Group Project</p>
                <div>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the second game I developed in my first semester, and
                        the
                        first group game project I worked on in the program. The assignment was to make an
                        AR game experience that could be played on a mobile device. After a few brainstorming
                        sessions,
                        we decided on an FPS where you would spawn a castle using
                        plane detection and once you do a bunch of tiny guys start shooting at you. The goal is
                        to clear
                        them all out while dodging their shots by moving around.
                        My contribution to this project was assisting with AR implementation, the design of the
                        castle,
                        the shooting mechanics, touch screen controls, and UI/UX and HUD design.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We only had a few weeks to put this project together, and I'm
                        very
                        proud of what we made and how much we learned in such a short amount of time.
                        My biggest takeaways from this project was the value of working on projects as a team.
                        They say
                        teams are stronger than heroes, and that was proven to me
                        when we worked on this project. Below is a demo video of our nearly finalized game.
