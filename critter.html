                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Critter is my senior project game in the GIMM program. I came up with the idea for it in my 2nd semester after realizing 
                        that maybe a full fledged souls-like game was a bit too ambitious for my first real game. I wanted to make a game that was simple, but could still have a lot of depth
                        and replayability to it. My idea, was a roguelike where you play as a mouse and have to explore a house to find cheese. By finding cheese, you can unlock new abilities that
                        will help you traverse farther and faster, and therefore acquire more cheese. But while exploring, you have to be careful, because the house is inhabiteed by a hungry cat
                        that roams around and will try to eat you if you venture too close. If you get caught by the cat, you will die and lose all of your progress from that session. 
                        The total amount of cheese you have collected will be your score, and the goal is to get as much cheese as you can before you die.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This project is still in progress, as of now I have completed the main gameplay code, 3D models, and sound design. 
                        In this project I have tried to push my skills as a game designer and programmer, utilizing good OOP practices and design patterns to make the code 
                        as clean and efficient as possible, while also being easy to read and build upon. I still have a lot of work to do, but I am very proud of what I have accomplished so far.
