                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the first project that I worked on in the program. I
                        was just
                        starting working in Unity and in Animate, as you can
                        see from my state of the art animation and shading. We had to chose one of three 2D stub
                        games,
                        a platformer,
                        tower defense, or top down shooter, and make our own game out of them. I chose the
                        platformer,
                        and I decided to create a
                        game that combines platforming challenges with metroidvania-like exploration and
                        progression.
                        The player explores the interior
                        of a scary haunted pyramid, and has find movement upgrades in order to survive and
                        escape.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My initial idea for the game was much
                        grander than I ended up being able to make, but I'm still proud of what I came up with.
                        The
                        biggest things I took from this game
                        were learning how to work in sprints, avoiding out-scoping myself, and what makes a
                        small game
                        punch above its weight class.
                        When I look back on this game now, all that I see is everything that is wrong with it
                        and how
                        much better I could do it now,
                        which I think that shows how far I've come. Below is a trailer that I made for this game
                        in my
                        current Interactive Audio/Video class.
