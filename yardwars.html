                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This project was my first ever experience with local multiplayer in Unity. 
                        In a group of 3 we put together a 2-4 player experience where players must fight to keep trash out of their yard, and instead in their neighbors.
                        My role on the team was Gameplay Director. I was responsible for coding the multiplayer mechanics, 
                        such as assigning controls and instantiating player characters. I was also in charge of the player movement code, and I programmed the dog AI
                        using state machines.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We had to implement AI into our game somehow, so I had the idea that a dog that runs around and poops, adding trash to whoevers yard he's in, 
                        would be a fun gameplay mechanic. There were challenges with the multiplayer mechanics that I had to overcome, such as making sure the correct controllers get assigned 
                        to the correct players, and figuring out the spawning of the players once controls had been assigned. Overall I gained a lot of experience in Unity and I am very happy 
                        with how much fun the game ended up being.
