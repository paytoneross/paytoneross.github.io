                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was the second game I developed in my first semester, and
                        the
                        first group game project I worked on in the program. The assignment was to make an
                        AR game experience that could be played on a mobile device. After a few brainstorming
                        sessions,
                        we decided on an FPS where you would spawn a castle using
                        plane detection and once you do a bunch of tiny guys start shooting at you. The goal is
                        to clear
                        them all out while dodging their shots by moving around.
                        My contribution to this project was assisting with AR implementation, the design of the
                        castle,
                        the shooting mechanics, touch screen controls, and UI/UX and HUD design.
                    </p>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We only had a few weeks to put this project together, and I'm
                        very
                        proud of what we made and how much we learned in such a short amount of time.
                        My biggest takeaways from this project was the value of working on projects as a team.
                        They say
                        teams are stronger than heroes, and that was proven to me
                        when we worked on this project. Below is a demo video of our nearly finalized game.
